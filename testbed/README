# Experiments
The [testbed](.) folder contains scripts to perform experiments, analyze
results, and generate reports.

## 1. Running Experiments
The script [experiment.py](experiment.py) allows to run an experiment within the
environment [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html). Make sure
that you have set all desired properties in the file
[experiment.py](experiment.py) before. Different benchmark suites are specified
in [benchmark_suites.py](benchmark_suites.py). If you want to run your own
benchmark suite, you can add it to the folder [benchmarks](benchmarks) and
register it in the file [benchmark_suites.py](benchmark_suites.py).

Logs of your experiments are written to a results folder in the default folder
structure of [Downward Lab](https://lab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

## 2. Creating Reports
To create reports, you can use the [standard-report.py](standard-report.py)
script. For more information, see
[Downward Lab](https://lab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
The [reports.py](reports.py) script is an example for creating more
sophisticated reports and plots.
